                                        The department shall maintain technical documentation including Software
                                        application Architecture document. The architecture document should include
                                        application details such as Application Overview and functionalities, Component
                                        architecture diagram showing inter dependencies and any external dependencies,
                                        technology used, deployment architecture, deployment configurations, revision
                                        history of document etc. Updates to the document should be versioned as separate
                                        versions and maintained. The architecture document shall be shared in print
                                        along with the hosting request form or mailed to...............to respective
                                        SDC's email id's.
                                      
                                      
                                        The application will be hosted under Staging Server for a period of
                                        ................. from the date of presenting the filled application form for
                                        conducting Security Audit. If the process is not completed in the
                                        .............., the application will be deallocated from Staging Server without
                                        prior intimation.
                                      
                                      
                                        Security auditing of the application by any CERT-In empaneled agency has to be
                                        carried out in the hosting environment. A copy of the security certificate shall
                                        be provided to the SDC. The SDC should allow hosting on production servers only
                                        after receiving security audit certificates (safe to host certificate) which
                                        needs to be maintained in records.
                                      
                                      
                                        Due to stringent security policy implemented in the server, some of the
                                        functionalities of the application may not work as expected. All
                                        functionalitiesof the web application should be validated in the staging server.
                                      
                                      
                                        JKSDC has set a maximum space limitation on Web / Application to ............
                                        and Db Storage limitation to ............. for all departments for VM which can
                                        be increased upon usage.
                                      
                                      
                                        Access to the Database server will only be given from the application server.
                                        The database server cannot be accessed directly from Internet.
                                      
                                      
                                        Application level security is solely under the privilege of the department. It
                                        is the Department/authorized vendor's responsibility to tighten the security of
                                        the application. By the above condition, it should be accepted that the
                                        department shall take the following measures:
                                      
                                    
                                    The Department shall be commited to maintaining the security of its own application.
                                    Application Security needs to be a significant consideration during the development
                                    of any software. Additionally, security patches post production also needs to be
                                    factored into the contract with the application development vendor.

                                    Have maintenance contract such that technical support is available at any point of
                                    time to address any request for enhancement, upgrades, security remediation,
                                    migration and testing of the application. Upgrades/patches are frequently released
                                    by vendors/open communities for any software (including operating Sysytem, Database,
                                    Application Server, Programming technology such as Java, various code frameworks and
                                    commercial/open source libraries and components) to address added functionalities as
                                    well as security vulnerabilities. It is the responsibility of the application
                                    support team of the department to proactively identify patches to any tecnologies/
                                    components used in the application and apply these after proper testing.

                                    Periodic security auditing is necessary. The department shall get the sites audited
                                    once every 2 years by a CERT-IN empaneled agency. If an application is developed in
                                    an agile manner such that enhancements to the application are rolled out frequently,
                                    the department is required to have Security Audites done by a CERT-In empaneled
                                    agency once every 6 months.
                                  
                                        Once audited and hosting, the Department / Technical Lead shall raise a Change
                                        Request (CR) and submit the CR form to SDC if any subsequent change is to be
                                        made on the application including any configuration change or patch application.
                                      
                                    
                                    Updated Software Application Architecture Document also needs to be submitted. The
                                    Change Advisory Board shall verify the technical changes and evaluate if a
                                    subsequent security audit is required before the changes are deployed on the
                                    production server.
                                    
                                      
                                        If any change to the application is depolyed without intimation to the SDC, the
                                        CEO jaKeGa reserves the right to de-allocate domain name and pull down the
                                        website.
                                      
                                    
                                        As per the Data Center policy, there is a limit for maximum resource allocation
                                        of servers, and we can able to increase the same based on the utilization and
                                        requirements.

                                        While performing the hardening process, kindly exclude all cloud and monitoring
                                        services running in the server. These cloud services must be required for the
                                        communication between the VM and Cloud Management Portal.
                                      
                                      
                                        As per the security policy, it is mandatory that all the Cloud applications
                                        should undergo Security Audit by authorized agencies and present audit clearance
                                        certificate to SDC before going live.

                                        to the application software, the department will have to get the application
                                        re-audited before going online again.
